# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
# üéµ Speech and Song Emotion Classification using Deep Features and Neural Networks

This project focuses on classifying emotions from audio files containing **speech** data. It leverages deep audio feature extraction using **Librosa**, a **CNN-BiLSTM-Attention** based neural network model, and various regularization techniques to improve generalization and prevent overfitting.

## üìÇ Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of two main categories:
- **Speech Data:** `Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24`
- **Song Data:** `Audio_Song_Actors_01-24`

Each file is labeled with emotion codes which are mapped to the following emotions:
- `01`: Neutral
- `02`: Calm
- `03`: Happy
- `04`: Sad
- `05`: Angry
- `06`: Fearful
- `07`: Disgust
- `08`: Surprised

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

1. **Mount Google Drive:**
   - The dataset is loaded directly from Google Drive.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - MFCCs, Delta, Delta2
   - Chroma, Mel Spectrogram
   - Spectral Contrast, Tonnetz
   - Zero Crossing Rate, RMS Energy
   - All features are stacked and padded to a uniform length.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Label encoding
   - Stratified Train-Test split considering both emotion and modality (speech/song).

4. **Model Architecture:**
   - 1D CNN block with L2 regularization and dropout
   - BiLSTM layer with recurrent dropout
   - Attention mechanism
   - Dense layers with L2 regularization and dropout
   - Softmax output for multi-class classification

5. **Training:**
   - EarlyStopping with `val_accuracy` monitoring
   - Epochs: 80
   - Batch Size: 32
